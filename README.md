# Mushroom Binary Classification With ANN
In this project I will apply the artificial neural network model to the Mushroom Dataset from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/mushroom-classification.

This project was done for training purposes only. I wanted to see how different hyperparameters can affect a model, and to practice to build Sequntial models using Tensorflow.Keras.

The problem statement:
 - to identify whether each species is poisonous or not.

The goal of this project:
 - practice building artifical neural networks with Keras;
 - compare models with different parameters.
